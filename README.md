Course Lookup Program â€“ Python Dictionary Example

Features:

Consolidated course data using a single nested dictionary
Dual search functionality (course number or instructor last name)

Easily extendable to include additional fields (e.g., office hours, credits)

Planned improvement:
Add instructor-focused view to display all courses taught by a professor along with their office hours for quick student reference.
